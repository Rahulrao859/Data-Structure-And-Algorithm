# Data-Structure-And-Algorithm
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repo contains my personal collection of various DSA problems and solutions, which I have implemented in multiple C++ languages.  It covers fundamental data structures, algorithms, and common coding challenges that are frequently asked in technical interviews.
